State Machine  
- A mathematic model for computer programs or sequential logic description.
- A sequential logic event can be considered as an abstract machine with a finite number of states. The machine is in one state only at a given time.
- Change from one state to another can be initiated by a triggering event or condition (state transition)s

Race and Hazard  
- Race and Hazard: a type of flaw in electronic system. A device may received signals with different delay due to different paths which may causes transient error in output.
- In sequential logic，the next state and output are determined by combinational logic,  where race and hazard may occur. Mistakes may be introduced in the whole sequential system. 
- Race and Hazard can be avoided by synchronous sequential logic. 

## ASM(Algorithmic State Machine) Chart
- It resembles software flow chart, but it has corresponding hardware structure.
